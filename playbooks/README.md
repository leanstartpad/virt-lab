# Ansible playbooks for virt-lab

This is a collection of small Ansible playbooks for setting up new guests.
These may be run by `virt-lab` after the guests have been created. You can also
have `virt-lab` run other custom playbooks by specifying them in the
`virt-lab.cfg` file.

## Playbook

* `local-dns.yaml` - Setup local DNS resolution with the systemd resolver
* `local-mirror.yaml` - Setup and update a local CentOS repository mirror
* `set-sshkeys.yaml` - Install pre-defined ssh-keys
* `wait.yaml` - Wait for systems to become reachable

### local-dns

### local-mirror

The local-mirror playbook will create a local CentOS repository in a guest in
order to speed up package installs when spinning up CentOS based guests. Define
the variable `local_mirror` to specify the host name of the guest hosting the
repositories.

Example configuration for local-mirror playbook.

    [.global]
    var.local_mirror = mirror01.{domain}

    [local-mirror]
    desc = Local CentOS 7 mirror
    guests = 1
    namefmt = mirror{guest:02d}
    distro = centos7
    disksize = 20
    group.local_mirrors = 1
    postcreate = ansible-playbook -i {scriptdir}/inventory.sh {playbookdir}/local-mirror.yaml

### set-sshkeys

### wait


## Running the playbooks

Specify a `postcreate` option to run the playbooks automatically after the
guest have been created. `ansible-playbook` may be run directly, or
alternatively, a shell script may be specified which can run one or more
playbooks, and well as other local commands.

Use the ansible-playbook `-i {scriptdir}/inventory.sh` option to generate a
dynamic inventory of the guests created by `virt-lab`.  Host groups and host
variables can be specified in the `virt-lab.cfg`. Additional static variables
can be specifed with multiple ansible-playbook `-i` command line arguments.

### Running ansible-playbook directly.

Setup the `postcreate` option to run `ansible-playbook` and specify the
playbooks you wish to run.  Additional custom playbooks may also be run to
perform setup on the newly created guests. These custom playbooks may be
located in a custom directory.

Example 1:

    [mylab]
    guests = 6
    domain = example.com
    bridge = vlbr0
    gateway = 192.168.123.1
    postcreate = ansible-playbook -i {scriptdir}/inventory.sh
                 {playbookdir}/local-dns.yaml
                 {playbookdir}/wait.yaml

Example 2:

Example running custom playbooks with static host and group variables. The
playbook files and inventory directory are expected to be in the current
working directory in this example.

    [mylab]
    guests = 6
    domain = example.com
    bridge = vlbr0
    gateway = 192.168.123.1
    postcreate = ansible-playbook
                 -i {scriptdir}/inventory.sh
                 -i inventory/mylab
                 {playbookdir}/wait.yaml
                 playbook1.yaml
                 playbook2.yaml

### Running ansible-playbook from a script

Alternatively, you can specify a shell script in the `postcreate` option, which
can run `ansible-playbook` or perform any other logic needed.  A set of
environment variable are created for the script.

Example:

    [mylab]
    guests = 6
    domain = example.com
    bridge = vlbr0
    gateway = 192.168.123.1
    postcreate = mypostcreate.sh

Example script:

    #!/bin/sh
    echo "Running post create script for ${VIRTLAB_NAME}"
    ansible-playbook -i ${VIRTLAB_SCRIPTDIR}/inventory.sh ${VIRTLAB_PLAYBOOKDIR}/wait.yaml
    # Do other tasks here as needed.

## Host groups and variables

Ansible groups can be defined in the `virt-lab.cfg` file for playbooks and
roles. Groups are specified as options in the form `group.<group_name>`. The
value of the group options is a comma separated list of guest numbers. The
first guest is number '1'.  A range of numbers can be specified in the form
`<from>..<to>`. The wildcard `*` is a shortcut to specify all of the guests.

Ansible hostvars are in the form `var.<hostvar_name>`. Hostvar values cascade
just like normal options, e.g. `.global` section, lab section, guest section
(if one).

Example:

    [mylab]
    guests = 12
    postcreate = ansible-playbook -i ...
    group.dbserver = 1
    group.webserver = 2,3,4
    group.test_client = 4..8
    group.krb_client = *
    var.myvar = myvalue

    [mylab.1]
    var.myvar = override
